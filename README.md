Got it ✅ You want an **outstanding `README.md`** for your **Multi Shop POS (backend)** project. Since this is a **Node.js + Express + MongoDB backend** for a multi-shop billing & inventory POS system, I’ll craft a professional GitHub-ready README that looks polished and clear.

Here’s a first version you can directly put in your repo 👇

# 🛒 Multi Shop POS – Backend

A **scalable Point of Sale (POS) backend system** built with **Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (Mongoose)**.
This project powers **multi-shop businesses** like utility shops, grocery stores, and markets, enabling **billing, inventory management, user roles, and multi-tenant shop support**.

---

## ✨ Features

* 🔐 **Role-based Access Control** – Admin, Manager, Cashier
* 🏪 **Multi-shop support** – Each shop has its own inventory & staff
* 📦 **Inventory management** – Add, update, and track stock levels
* 💳 **Billing system** – Manage sales, invoices, and receipts
* 📊 **Reports** – Sales & stock insights
* ⚡ **Shop scoping middleware** – Ensures requests always belong to the correct shop
* 🌐 **REST API** – Easy integration with any frontend (React, mobile apps, etc.)

---

## 🏗 Tech Stack

* **Backend Framework:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) + [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
* **Database:** [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
* **Authentication:** JWT-based auth with role support
* **Other Tools:**

  * Middleware for shop scope (`x-shop-id` header / user shopId)
  * Indexing for performance (e.g., unique product SKUs per shop)

## 🚀 API Overview

### 🔑 Auth

* `POST /api/auth/register` → Register Admin/Manager/Cashier
* `POST /api/auth/login` → Login & get JWT

### 🏪 Shops

* `POST /api/shops` → Create shop (Admin only)
* `GET /api/shops` → List shops

### 👥 Users

* `POST /api/users` → Assign Manager/Cashier to a shop
* `GET /api/users` → List users by shop

### 📦 Products & Inventory

* `POST /api/products` → Add product to shop
* `GET /api/products` → Get shop’s products
* `PUT /api/products/:id` → Update product

### 💳 Sales

* `POST /api/sales` → Create a new sale/bill
* `GET /api/sales` → Sales history per shop

⚡ **Note:** All shop-specific endpoints require either:

* `x-shop-id` header, OR
* Authenticated user with `shopId`

---

## 🧑‍💻 Development Notes

* Enforces **unique SKU per shop** with:

  ```js
  ProductSchema.index({ shopId: 1, sku: 1 }, { unique: true, sparse: true });
  ```
* Middleware ensures `req.shopId` is always set:

  ```js
  x-shop-id: <shopId>
  ```
* Supports multi-tenant scaling for multiple shops from one backend.

---

## 🛠 Roadmap

* [ ] Add barcode scanning support
* [ ] Generate PDF invoices/receipts
* [ ] Sales analytics dashboard
* [ ] Offline-first sync (future mobile app integration)

👉 Do you want me to also prepare a **frontend README (React-based POS UI)** in advance, so when you start the frontend part it’s already structured like a professional repo pair?
